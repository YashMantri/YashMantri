<h1 align="center">Hi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="40px" />, I'm Yash</h1>

I love coding and I am passionate about using technology to provide solutions that require creative thinking. I like to explore data and derive insights to enable data-driven decision-making.

My continuous desire to work with data led me to secure the role of Data Engineer (AS) at Goldman Sachs.

After completing Master of Science in Computer Science from SUNY Buffalo, I joined Egen Solutions where I worked on data pipelines to create Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) using Apache Airflow, and built staging tasks and production tasks using Python, AWS and PostgreSql. I also got exposure to resolved 10+ issues on existing data pipelines by using stack trace of AWS Batch, Cloud-watch and Jenkins for debugging.

I have 3 years of professional work experience as a Software Engineer (in Data) at Purplle.com (an E-commerce startup) where I achieved the opportunity to work on all the stages of the E-commerce life-cycle right from product onboarding to analyzing feedbacks of customer experience.

I come with solid programming expertise in Python, MySQL, PHP, AWS, and Google Bigquery. Enthusiastic team player, a fast learner with creative problem solving and great communication skills.

I am currently exploring Docker containers and Kafka, an event streaming platform to understand more about PaaS and Distributed Systems.
